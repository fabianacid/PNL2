        "Los gráficos son matrices de atención de un Transformer, donde cada imagen muestra cómo un head en una capa atiende a diferentes posiciones de la secuencia.\n",

        "Observaciones por capas y heads:\n",
        "\n",
        "Layer 1 Head 1\n",
        "\n",
        "Se ve un patrón fuerte (columnas muy brillantes) en posiciones específicas, por ejemplo cerca de la posición 7.\n",

        "Esto indica que este head se especializó en “atender” casi siempre a un mismo token clave sin importar el query.\n",

        "Layer 1 Head 2\n",
        "\n",
        "La atención está más dispersa, aunque hay focos muy marcados (en la esquina inferior derecha y alrededor de la posición 12).\n",
        "\n",
        "Esto sugiere que este head aprende dependencias locales y algunas más globales.\n",

        "La atención se distribuye más equilibrada que en Layer 1.\n",

        "Hay patrones diagonales débiles. Indica que el modelo empieza a capturar dependencias secuenciales (cada posición se relaciona con su vecina).\n",

        "Conclusión: empieza a aparecer estructura de lenguaje.\n",
        "\n",
        "Layer 2 Head 2\n",
        "\n",
        "También hay focos brillantes en posiciones concretas, pero distribuidos más “cuadrados”, como bloques.\n",

        "Esto es típico cuando el modelo detecta subestructuras repetitivas (ej. prefijos, sufijos, segmentos dentro de la secuencia).\n",

        "\n",
        "### Interpretación general:\n",
        "\n",
        "En las primeras capas (Layer 1) la atención es más rígida o sesgada a ciertos tokens fijos. Esto suele pasar en entrenamientos iniciales: algunos heads actúan como “detectores de posición clave”.\n",
        "\n",
        "En las capas más profundas (Layer 2) la atención se vuelve más estructurada, equilibrada y con patrones más interpretables (diagonales, bloques), lo que indica que el modelo ya está aprendiendo dependencias entre diferentes partes de la secuencia.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusiones clave:\n",
        "\n",
        "Los heads ya muestran especialización distinta (unos se enfocan en posiciones fijas, otros en relaciones distribuidas).\n",
        "\n",
        "Hay evidencia de que el modelo aprende dependencias locales y globales.\n",
        "\n",
        "El entrenamiento está funcionando: no son atenciones aleatorias, sino que hay patrones emergentes claros."
